# Welcome to **RayEngine**.

This is a project i made because i was bored. Inspired by many others, i decided to try to make something kind of like an intermediate between pure graphics, and a completely abstracted engine. Hence the birth of _RayEngine_.



## The Idea:

By opting [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/) as the backend, i decided to build my Engine/Framework.
Luckily, Raylib has a special repository called [RayLib_cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs), created specifically to create bindings for the C# programming Language.

So after a lot of Reading, and writing code, i finally finished what is arguably 1.0 of the _RayEngine_.Opting for inspiration from the Unity Engine, and writing a lot of code to abstract away all the RayLib, into my framwork that is very Object orientated in nature.

Above you can find the Docs above, along with the API to reffer when developing games on this Engine.
Chao!
