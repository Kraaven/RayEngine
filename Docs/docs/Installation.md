# Installation

This Game Engine/FrameWork was written in C#, with no GUI whatsoever to aid in modification or visually representing your work. Hence, It is required to use an IDE of some kind to write your code.

## The IDE
1. This Engine was developed on the [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) IDE, and so this page will you Rider as its source of reference.
2. However, Visual Studio is also a powerfull IDE for C# and C++, and as long as you can understand the Docs, and do some basic googling, you should also be able to get the Engine Running.
