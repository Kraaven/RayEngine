# RayEngine

I wanted some good practice with C#, like pure C#, but i never figured out a good way to go about it. Eventually, i figure out i could pickup either OpenGL or RayLib and create something like a wrapper for it to make a "Game Framework"

## Implementation
- Now technically, Raylib is a Game framework in iself, it does not need to be built on any further to be used. 
- However, me being used to Unity's style of things, i decided to try adding a Unity like GameObject - Component System on top of RayLib, so its more friendly to use in terms of being a game engine.

- Feel free to browse the documentation for the framework [here](https://kraaven.github.io/RayEngine/), and do give me feedback if ur free.

- I dont intend to continue working on this engine, but i consider its core features complete, it being able to render "Meshs" and have Colliders.
